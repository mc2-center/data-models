A **File** represents a single data unit within a dataset, such as a document, spreadsheet, or image. In research and data management, files are essential for storing and organizing raw or processed data. They provide the foundation for data analysis, sharing, and compliance with storage policies. Properly formatted file entries ensure data can be retrieved, validated, and referenced consistently across projects.

The attributes in this model describe key metadata about each file, including its format, assay type, species, and associated dataset. These details help maintain file traceability and usability within data repositories.

## **Why You Should Contribute File Entries**
Contributing file entries ensures that critical data files are accessible, organized, and easily retrievable. By documenting your files with key metadata, you enhance their usability in research workflows and support data sharing and collaboration. Accurate and detailed file entries also help prevent data loss, streamline future analyses, and facilitate compliance with research data management policies.

### **Who Should Be Contributing File Entries?**
1. **Researchers** – Share and organize key datasets and processed results to improve reproducibility and collaboration across projects.  
2. **Data Managers** – Maintain an organized structure for large-scale data repositories by documenting file attributes like formats, assays, and species.  
3. **Project Leads** – Ensure data generated by your research projects is categorized and described, making it easier for teams to access and reuse.  
4. **Bioinformaticians and Data Analysts** – Provide detailed metadata to streamline data integration, analysis pipelines, and compatibility with downstream tools.  
5. **Collaborative Consortia Members** – Contribute shared resources to foster data transparency, enabling broader collaboration and multi-institution research efforts.
