An **Educational Resource** refers to any material designed to support learning and instruction. These resources can take many forms, such as videos, textbooks, simulations, or interactive activities, and are intended to be used by various audiences, including students, teachers, researchers, and lifelong learners. In  MC<sup>2</sup> Center-supported projects, these entries document key information about educational resources to ensure they are accessible, properly categorized, and easy to reference.

This model defines attributes to describe each resource, including its title, topic, educational level, and usage, to facilitate discovery, sharing, and reuse within educational systems.

## **Why You Should Contribute Educational Resource Entries**
Contributing educational resource entries helps expand access to valuable learning materials and supports knowledge sharing across the research and educational community. By documenting your resources thoroughly, you increase their discoverability, usability, and impact. Well-structured educational entries also provide opportunities for collaboration, curriculum development, and outreach, ensuring your work benefits a broader audience.

### **Who Should Be Contributing Educational Resource Entries?**
1. **Educators and Trainers** – Increase the reach of your courses, workshops, and materials by making them easily accessible and categorized for learners.  
2. **Curriculum Developers** – Contribute structured content that aligns with learning objectives and supports interdisciplinary research education.  
3. **Researchers** – Share resources like tutorials, research guides, and recorded presentations to help others understand your methods and findings.  
4. **Knowledge Dissemination Teams** – Ensure your organization’s educational resources are well-documented, improving outreach and engagement with students, collaborators, and stakeholders.  
5. **Institutional Administrators** – Facilitate better knowledge sharing within and across institutions by maintaining a well-organized repository of training materials.
