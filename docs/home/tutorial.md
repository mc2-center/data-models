### Found an error?

We are always looking for ways to improve our data models.  If there is
an issue with an existing term - or if you have a suggestion - [let us know]!

Or, if you would like to contribute to the project directly, read our
[contribution guidelines].

!!!important
    Changing existing terminology may result in breaking changes downstream,
    so not all suggestions may be considered unless they are well-justified.
