### **Welcome!**  
The MC<sup>2</sup> Center Data Models Explorer enables structured, standardized documentation of data and resources for the [Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal](https://www.cancercomplexity.synapse.org/). 

This platform is designed to support **researchers**, **developers**, and **data contributors** by enhancing collaboration, reproducibility, and data discovery through clear metadata standards. Documenting key attributes of datasets, studies, publications, and more ensures that research outputs remain accessible and reusable across teams and projects.

### **What Can You Do Here?**  
The platform supports the documentation and upload of a variety of resource types. Choose the resource relevant to your work from the table below:
