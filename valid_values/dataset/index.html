<tr><td>3&#x27; RNA-seq                                                         </td><td>A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>

First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>

<tr><td>Proximity Ligation Assay                                           </td><td>A technique that leverages immunoassay and DNA amplification technology to detect protein-protein interactions with high specificity and sensitivity. A sample is prepared and then exposed to primary antibodies raised in different species recognizing the target epitopes on the proteins of interest. Then, secondary antibodies that are tagged with short oligonucleotides and that target each primary antibody are added. Next, a mixture comprised of a ligase, PCR components and a connector oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to both oligonucleotide tags and can prime rolling DNA circle synthesis, are added and the sample is subjected to real-time PCR to amplify the DNA circles. Rolling circle synthesis and amplification is only possible if the protein epitopes are in close proximity (i.e. in a protein complex).

Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>
<tr><td>TCR Sequencing                                                     </td><td>A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>

<tr><td>Suspended Microchannel Resonator                                   </td><td>Particles are weighed in real-time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as they flow through a hollow cantilever. In addition to weighing particles with femtogram precision, the SMR can also measure mass density with a resolution of 10-4 g/mL. This is possible since the microchannel resonant frequency is determined by the difference in mass of the particle with respect to that of the displaced fluid. Thus, the particle&#x27;s density is determined by measuring its mass in two fluids of different densities. The SMR can measure the growth of single cells as well as the absorption of biomolecules to microchannel walls. Scaling the current SMR design by ten-fold will result in a thousand-fold improvement in mass resolution (attogram) and thereby enable single viruses to be weighed with high precision.                                                                                                         </td></tr>

They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).
