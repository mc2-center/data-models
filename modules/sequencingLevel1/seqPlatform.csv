AB 5500 Genetic Analyzer,"A proprietary next-generation DNA sequencing system from Applied Biosystems that utilizes DNA ligase. DNA fragments attached to beads are clonally amplified and ligated to fluorescently labeled ""interrogation probes"". Ligation frees the fluor, which is detected and identifies the specific probe.
