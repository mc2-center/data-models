Publication Abstract,The abstract of the publication.,True,_None_,"""This article explores the developmental effects of cannabinoid exposure in zebrafish, one of the important vertebrate model systems in functional and comparative genomics. Drawing from a series of rigorous molecular analysis, the study establishes that prolonged exposure to cannabinoids impairs critical developmental processes at particular stages. The findings of this research not only contribute to our understanding of zebrafish neurobiology but also raise critical implications for human health, particularly in the context of increasing medicinal use of cannabinoids."""
