They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).
