Sequencing Level 2,Sequencing data that has been aligned with a reference genome.,,"Component, SequencingLevel2_id, SequencingLevel1 Key, Filename, NGS Library Strategy, NGS Library Source Material, NGS Library Source Molecule, NGS Library Selection Method, NGS Library Layout, NGS Sequencing Platform, NGS Sequencing Design Description, NGS Raw Reads, NGS Stitched Reads, NGS Aligned Reads, NGS Deduplicated Reads, NGS Trimmed Reads, NGS MapQ30, NGS Unique Bases, NGS Read Length, NGS Sequencing Coverage, Genomic Reference, Software and Version",FALSE,,,,,
SequencingLevel2_id,A unique identifier used by schematic for record updates and as a reference key in other schemas,,,TRUE,,,,MC2,unique
NGS Stitched Reads,"Represents consensus from the overlapping sequence of read 1 and 2. This is a % of the aligned reads that were overlapped and consensus confirmed, usually upward of 80% but less in terms of number of reads than aligned reads",,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Aligned Reads,Is a sequence that has been aligned to a gene/probe. Typically these reads can number from the hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. In GeoMx alignment is via mapping the RTS ID to a white list of sequences that represent targets.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Deduplicated Reads,Is the replacement of blocks of duplicate data with a Virtual Index Pointer linking the new sub-block to the existing block of data in a duplicate repository. This is used to reduce the amount of space need to store the data.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Trimmed Reads,Number of the reads remaining after trimming has been applied.,,,FALSE,,,,STE,num
NGS MapQ30,Number of reads with Quality >= 30.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
