SequencingLevel2_id,A unique identifier used by schematic for record updates and as a reference key in other schemas,,,TRUE,,Sequencing Level 2,,MC2,unique,string
NGS Stitched Reads,"Represents consensus from the overlapping sequence of read 1 and 2. This is a % of the aligned reads that were overlapped and consensus confirmed, usually upward of 80% but less in terms of number of reads than aligned reads",,,FALSE,,Sequencing Level 2,,HTAN,num,number
NGS Aligned Reads,Is a sequence that has been aligned to a gene/probe. Typically these reads can number from the hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. In GeoMx alignment is via mapping the RTS ID to a white list of sequences that represent targets.,,,FALSE,,Sequencing Level 2,,HTAN,num,number
NGS Deduplicated Reads,Is the replacement of blocks of duplicate data with a Virtual Index Pointer linking the new sub-block to the existing block of data in a duplicate repository. This is used to reduce the amount of space need to store the data.,,,FALSE,,Sequencing Level 2,,HTAN,num,number
NGS Trimmed Reads,Number of the reads remaining after trimming has been applied.,,,FALSE,,Sequencing Level 2,,STE,num,number
NGS MapQ30,Number of reads with Quality >= 30.,,,FALSE,,Sequencing Level 2,,HTAN,num,number
