SequencingLevel2_id,A unique identifier used by schematic for record updates and as a reference key in other schemas,,,TRUE,,,,MC2,unique
NGS Raw reads,"Reads not yet analyzed in any way to be used for data analysis. The number of reads that pass filter from the flow cell represented in the FASTQ file. ",,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Stitched reads,"Represents consensus from the overlapping sequence of read 1 and 2. This is a % of the aligned reads that were overlapped and consensus confirmed, usually upward of 80% but less in terms of number of reads than aligned reads",,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Aligned reads,Is a sequence that has been aligned to a gene/probe. Typically these reads can number from the hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. In GeoMx alignment is via mapping the RTS ID to a white list of sequences that represent targets.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Deduplicated reads,Is the replacement of blocks of duplicate data with a Virtual Index Pointer linking the new sub-block to the existing block of data in a duplicate repository. This is used to reduce the amount of space need to store the data.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Trimmed reads,Number of the reads remaining after trimming has been applied.,,,FALSE,,,,STE,num
NGS MapQ30,Number of reads with Quality >= 30.,,,FALSE,,,,HTAN,num
NGS Unique Bases,Count of unique basecalls present in the data.,,,FALSE,,,,CDS/Sequencing,num
NGS Sequencing Coverage,Depth of coverage on assembly used. Found by (Unique Aligned Basecalls)/(Reference Length),,,FALSE,,,,CDS/Sequencing,num
