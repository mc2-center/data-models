Capture Area,"Area (or Capture Area) - One of the either four or two active regions where tissue can be placed on a Visium slide. Each area is intended to contain only one tissue sample. Slide areas are named consecutively from top to bottom: A1, B1, C1, D1 for Visium slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and A, B for CytAssist slides with 11 mm Capture Area. Both CytAssist slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and Gateway Slides contain only two slide areas, A1 and D1.","A, B, C, D, A1, B1, C1, D1",,FALSE,,visium,,HTAN,str
Slide Version,Version of imaging slide used. Slide version is critical for the analysis of the sequencing data as different slides have different capture area layouts.,"V1, V2, V3, V4",,TRUE,,visium,,HTAN,str
