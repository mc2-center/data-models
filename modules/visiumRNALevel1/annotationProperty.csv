10xVisiumRNALevel1_id,"Unique row identifier, used as a primary key for record updates",,,TRUE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,MC2,unique,string
Visium Run ID,A unique identifier for this individual run (typically associated with a single slide) of the spatial transcriptomic processing workflow.,,,TRUE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,unique,string
Visium Capture Area,"Area (or Capture Area) - One of the either four or two active regions where tissue can be placed on a Visium slide. Each area is intended to contain only one tissue sample. Slide areas are named consecutively from top to bottom: A1, B1, C1, D1 for Visium slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and A, B for CytAssist slides with 11 mm Capture Area. Both CytAssist slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and Gateway Slides contain only two slide areas, A1 and D1.","A, B, C, D, A1, B1, C1, D1",,FALSE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,str,string
Visium Slide Version,Version of imaging slide used. Slide version is critical for the analysis of the sequencing data as different slides have different capture area layouts.,"V1, V2, V3, V4",,TRUE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,str,string

Visium Spatial Library Construction Method,Process which results in the creation of a library from fragments of DNA using cloning vectors or oligonucleotides with the role of adaptors [OBI_0000711],"Smart-seq2, Smart-SeqV4, 10xV1.0, 10xV1.1, 10xV2, 10xV3, 10xV3.1, Drop-seq, inDropsV2, inDropsV3, TruDrop, Nextera XT",,TRUE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,str,string
Visium Slide ID,"For Visium, it is the unique identifier printed on the label of each Visium slide. The serial number starts with V followed by a number which can range between one through five and ends with a dash and a three digit number, such as 123. For CosMx, this refers to the loaded Flow Cell ID. For Xenium, this ID indicates the slide orientation, as it matches the relative location of the ID on the physical Xenium slide.",,,TRUE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,str,string
Visium Image Re-orientation,"To ensure good fiducial alignment and tissue spots detection, it is important to correct for this shift in orientation.","True, False",,FALSE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,bool,boolean
Visium Permeabilization Time,Fixed and stained tissue sections are permeabilized for different times. Each Capture Area captures polyadenylated mRNA from the attached tissue section. Measure is provided in minutes.,,,FALSE,,10x Visium RNA Level 1,,HTAN,num,number
