Attribute,Description,Required,Validation Rules
10x Visium Spatial Transcriptomics - RNA-seq Level 1,Files contain raw RNA-seq data associated with spot/slide data.,False,_None_
VisiumRNALevel1_id,"Unique row identifier, used as a primary key for record updates",True,unique
Run ID,A unique identifier for this individual run (typically associated with a single slide) of the spatial transcriptomic processing workflow.,True,unique
[Capture Area](../valid_values/visiumRNALevel1.md#attribute-capture-area),"Area (or Capture Area) - One of the either four or two active regions where tissue can be placed on a Visium slide. Each area is intended to contain only one tissue sample. Slide areas are named consecutively from top to bottom: A1, B1, C1, D1 for Visium slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and A, B for CytAssist slides with 11 mm Capture Area. Both CytAssist slides with 6.5 mm Capture Area and Gateway Slides contain only two slide areas, A1 and D1.",False,str
[Slide Version](../valid_values/visiumRNALevel1.md#attribute-slide-version),Version of imaging slide used. Slide version is critical for the analysis of the sequencing data as different slides have different capture area layouts.,True,str
