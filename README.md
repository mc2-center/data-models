## Overview

This project contains the released versions of the JSON-LD schemas for the
[Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal] (CCKP), and more broadly, MC2 Center.
You can learn more about the schemas/data models and other aspects of this
project in our portal documentation - coming soon! The MC2 Center data model
is in both CSV and JSON-LD format.

## Folder Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ templates/
```

### DCA Configuration

MC2 Center's configurations for the DCA is located in `./dca_config`.

### Documentation

All docs are located in the `./docs` directory and are written in Markdown
format. Some docs are generated before the site is built, which is handled
by the `hooks.py` script in `./scripts`.

### Valid Values

Valid values are separated into modules (located in `./modules`), where
various pieces of the data model can be updated, including the standard
terms/valid values.

#### Add a new valid value
 
When a new valid value needs to be added to the data model:

1. Research the term and make sure we do not already have a synonym for it
   that exists. Using NCIt is excellent for this, though sometimes looking
   outside of NCIt is necessary. If we do currently have a synonym in use,
   add the valid value as a "non preferred term" in the applicable attribute
   CSV in `./modules`. If not:

2. Add the valid value in the "attribute" column of the applicable csv in
the appropriate module folder. E.g. if a new tumor type needs to be added
go to `tumorType.csv` and add the new term in the attribute column). Fill
out the rest of the columns as completely as possible, this includes the
description, the required column, parent column, source column, non-preferred
terms column, the ontology identifier, url, NCIt Code, and any notes.
Please make a note of who added it and the date.

3. Be sure to look up any synonyms and add to the "non preferred terms"
   column. This will make annotating easier in the future.

#### Update a valid value

Please [open a ticket] and let the MC2 Center internal data team know the
reasoning behind why a valid value should be updated/removed.

### Annotation Templates

A collection of ready-for-use templates are available in `./templates`, that
can be used with the [Data Curator App (DCA)] to add/update entities on the
CCKP.

## How to Contribute

Thank you helping us continuously improve the MC2 Center data models!  To
contribute, please read our [contributing guidelines] on the docs site.


## Setup and Deployment Instructions

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python and Pip
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have it installed:

- Visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest stable release.
- During installation, ensure you check the option to **Add Python to PATH**.

Next, ensure that `pip` is also installed and configured. You can check by running:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

If `pip` is missing, you can install it by downloading and running `get-pip.py` from [pip's official site](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for this project.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This command creates a virtual environment named `venv` in your project directory.

Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should show the environment name (`venv`).

### 3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-table-reader-plugin
```

### 4. Preview the Documentation Site
Run the following command to start a local server and preview the documentation site:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open the displayed URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) in your browser to view the site.

### 5. Submit Built Pages to GitHub
To publish the documentation site on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Build the static site files:
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```
   This will generate a `site/` directory containing the built HTML files.

2. Commit the built files to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   git add site/
   git commit -m "Build site for deployment"
   git push origin `git subtree split --prefix site master`:gh-pages --force
   ```

3. Verify that the site is live at your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`).
