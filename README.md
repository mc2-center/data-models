## Overview

This repository contains the released versions of the JSON-LD schemas for the
[Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal] (CCKP), and more broadly, MC2 Center.
You can learn more about the schemas/data models and other aspects of this
project in our portal documentation - coming soon! The MC2 Center data model
is in both a csv and jsonld format.

### Folder Structure
Valid values are separated into modules (see the `modules` folder), where
various pieces of the data model can be updated, including the standard
terms/valid values (please see "Adding a new valid value" below).


## How to Contribute

### Development process

To edit the data model, modify the project in your own fork or in a feature
branch, then issue a PR once you are ready for the MC2 Center internal data
team to review and discuss.

Generally, you should:

1. **Branch off `main` and develop your contribution**. Ensure `main` is
   up-to-date in your local project, then create a new feature branch.
2. Push changes to the fork.
3. **Open a PR to (upstream) `main` once ready.**  Follow our PR template.
   Someone from the MC2 Center internal data team will then review, and either
   approve + merge or ask for futher discussion.
4. If approved and once the branch is merged into `main`, a workflow will run
   to generate a new `mc2.model.csv` and `mc2.model.jsonld`.

### Adding a new valid value
 
When a new valid value needs to be added to the data model:

1. Research the term and make sure we do not already have a synonym for it that
exists. Using NCIt is excellent for this, though sometimes looking outside of
NCIt is necessary. If we do currently have a synonym in use, add the valid value
as a "non preferred term" in the applicable attribute csv in the modules folder.
If not:

2. Add the valid value in the "attribute" column of the applicable csv in the
appropriate module folder. E.g. if a new tumor type needs to be added go to
the tumorType.csv and add the new term in the attribute column). Fill out the
rest of the columns as completely as possible, this includes the description,
the required column, parent column, source column, non preferred terms column,
the ontology identifier, url, NCIt Code, and any notes. Please make a note of
who added it and the date.

3. Be sure to look up any synonyms and add to the "non preferred terms" column.
This will make annotating easier in the future.

4. When ready to release a new version of the data model and a pull request is
made, the valid values will automatically get added to `mc2.model.csv` and its
JSON-LD file.


### Releasing a new version

This repository has a workflow in-place that will auto-update the next release
draft.  Whenever a PR is merged, the workflow will run and add it to the draft.

For versioning, we adopt [Semantic Versioning] (SemVer), which the workflow will
also determine, based on the PR(s) included in the next planned release. Specifically:
   * any PR labeled with `major` will increment `x`
   * any PR labeled with `minor` will increment `y`
   * any PR labeled with `patch` will increment `z`

> [!NOTE]
> Only _one_ number will increment, where `x` will take precedence, followed by
> `y`, then finally `z`.

To release a new version, go to [Releases] > edit the release draft > **Publish release**


### Updating documentation

The Data Models Explorer uses [MkDocs], [mkdocs-table-reader-plugin], and the
[Material theme]. All docs are located in the `docs` directory and
are written in Markdown format.

* **Update the docs site:**

  The docs site is configured to rebuild automatically whenever a change
  is found in the `docs` folder, `mc2.model.csv`, or `mkdocs.yml`
  (the MkDocs configuration file). No further manual steps are required.

* **To add a new page:**

    Create a Markdown file in `docs`, then add the page to the `nav` 
    setting in `mkdocs.yml`.

* **To test your changes:**

    Build a local docs site that will auto-reload with any changes:

    ```console
    $ mkdocs serve
    INFO    -  Building documentation...
    INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
    INFO    -  Documentation built in 0.51 seconds
    INFO    -  [10:20:58] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
    INFO    -  [10:20:58] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    ```

    This will serve the documentation on http://127.0.0.1:8000. Enter Ctrl + C
    to close the server.

    Note that to test locally, you will need to install the dependencies
    first (ideally in a virtual environment), e.g.

    ```console
    conda create -n docs python=3.12
    conda activate docs
    pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-table-reader-plugin
    ```
